          <Accordion title="Can this tool detect the size or stage of a tumor?">
            No, the tool currently focuses on detecting the presence and type of
            tumor, not its size or stage. Medical imaging experts are needed for

          <Accordion title="How accurate is the tumor detection system?">
            Our system has been trained on a large dataset and achieves high
            accuracy, but no AI model is 100% perfect. Results should be
            reviewed by a healthcare provider.
          </Accordion>
          <Accordion title="What should I do after getting the detection result?">
            If the result indicates a possible tumor, it's important to consult
            a neurologist or radiologist for further evaluation and diagnosis.
          </Accordion>
